Data set found in the R package Stat2Data. The data collecting began when a statistician movie fan decided to use statistics to study the movie ratings in his favorite movie guide, Movie and Video Guide (1996), by Leonard Maltin. Maltin rates movies on a one-star to four-star system, in increments of half-stars, with higher numbers being better. The guide also includes additional information on each film. The statistican used a random number generator to select a simple random sample of 100 movies rated by the Guide.
